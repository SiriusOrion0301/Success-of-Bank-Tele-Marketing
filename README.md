**Success of Bank Telemarketing using Machine Learning**
This repository contains code for predicting the success of bank telemarketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset that includes client details, previous campaign outcomes, and other relevant features to predict the likelihood of a successful telemarketing call.
## Usage

### Google Colab
1. Open `23f2003785_notebook_t32024.ipynb`.
2. Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top.
3. The notebook will open in Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook. It will automatically download the data from the repository and execute the code.

### Local Server or Cloud VM
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiriusOrion0301/Succes-of-Bank-Tele-Marketing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Success-of-Tele-Marketing
   ```
3. Open the colab in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
4. Run the notebook. The data will be downloaded automatically, and the code will execute smoothly without any additional configuration.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available in the repository.  It contains data about previous telemarketing campaigns, including features like age, job, marital status, education, and previous contact results, which are used to predict the success of future campaigns.
